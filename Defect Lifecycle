1. Explain about Defect Life Cycle.

The Defect Life Cycle (or Bug Life Cycle) is the structured process a defect follows from discovery to closure,
ensuring systematic handling and accountability in software testing.
It typically includes stages like New, Assigned, In Progress, Fixed, Verified, and Closed.

What is the Defect Life Cycle?

The Defect Life Cycle (also called Bug Life Cycle) is the sequence of stages a defect passes through during its existence in a software project.

It starts when a defect is identified and ends when it is closed after verification.

This cycle provides visibility, accountability, and control over defect management, helping teams maintain software quality.

Standard Stages of the Defect Life Cycle:
Here’s a typical flow:


Stage	                            Description
New              	   Tester discovers and reports the defect.
Assigned           	Defect is assigned to a developer for fixing.
In Progress     	  Developer starts working on the defect.
Fixed	Developer     resolves the defect and marks it as fixed.
Verified	          Tester re-tests to confirm the fix works correctly.
Closed	            If verified successfully, the defect is closed.
Reopened	          If the fix fails, the defect is reopened and sent back to the developer.
Deferred/Rejected 	Sometimes defects are postponed (deferred) or considered invalid (rejected).

Why is the Defect Life Cycle Important?

Prevents defects from being overlooked by ensuring every bug has a clear status.

Improves communication between testers, developers, and managers.

Helps prioritize defects based on severity and impact.

Ensures accountability by defining ownership at each stage


2. What is Test Metrics? Explain with example. 

What are Test Metrics?
Test Metrics are quantitative measures used to assess the efficiency, effectiveness, and quality of the software testing process.

They provide objective data to track progress, identify bottlenecks, and improve overall testing practices.

In simple terms: Metrics help you measure how well testing is being done and how good the product quality is.

Types of Test Metrics
Here are some commonly used categories:

Process Metrics

Measure the efficiency of the testing process.

Example: Test Case Execution Rate (how many test cases are executed per day).

Product Metrics

Measure the quality of the software product.

Example: Defect Density (number of defects per module or per lines of code).

Project Metrics

Measure project progress and resource utilization.


Example: Test Effort Variance (difference between planned vs. actual testing effort).

Examples of Test Metrics
Metric	                                                          Formula	                                                        Example
Defect Density                  	        Defects found / Size of module (LOC or Function Points)	                   20 defects in a 1000 LOC module → 0.02 defects per LOC
Test Case Execution Rate                 	(Number of test cases executed / Total test cases) × 100%     	           80 executed out of 100 → 80% execution rate
Defect Removal Efficiency (DRE)	          (Defects removed during testing / Total defects found) × 100%	             90 defects removed out of 100 → 90% DRE
Test Coverage	                    (Number of requirements covered by test cases / Total requirements) × 100%	       45 requirements covered out of 50 → 90% coverage


Why Test Metrics Matter:

Track progress: Know how much testing is completed.

Improve quality: Identify weak areas in the product.

Decision-making: Helps managers decide if the product is ready for release.

Continuous improvement: Provides insights to refine testing strategies.
